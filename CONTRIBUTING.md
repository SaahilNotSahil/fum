# Contribution Guide

Thank you for your interest in contributing! Please follow these guidelines to keep the project clean and manageable.

## Branching
- Always work on the `dev` branch.
- Never push directly to `main`; changes should go through `dev` first.
- Use feature branches (e.g., `fix-command` or `add-something`) for new additions.

## Commit Rules
- Keep commits focused on a single change.
- Use meaningful commit messages.
- Split up commits for different purposes (e.g., bug fixes, refactoring, new features should be separate commits).

## Pull Requests
- Always create PRs against the `dev` branch.
- Ensure your changes do not break existing functionality.
- Keep PRs focused on a single purpose.

Happy fumming!!
